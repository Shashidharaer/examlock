          FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)
          <br />
          This is a general guideline of the Family Educational Rights and
          Privacy Act (FERPA) for Parents and Eligible Students. For a more
          detailed explanation, and frequently asked questions please visit the
          Department of Education website at www.ed.gov. What is FERPA? Under
          the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), parents or
          eligible students have the right to request any education record,
          including grades, performance, requests for amendments, and control
          over how these documentations are publicly shared. FERPA only applies
          to educational institutions that currently receive funding from the
          Department of Education. <br />
          What constitutes an “Eligible Student”?
          <br />
          Once the student becomes 18 years of age or is enrolled in a
          post-secondary institution, regardless of age, they become an
          “eligible student” and have the right of privacy transfers from the
          parent to the eligible student. As an eligible student, they maintain
          the right over disclosure of their educational records, requests for
          amendments, and public disclosure to third-parties, as allowed by
          FERPA, and the right to file a complaint with the Department of
          Education. <br />
          Access to Educational Records
          <br />
          Under the FERPA policy, a school must provide a parent or eligible
          student with their education records within 45 days of request for
          documents. The school must provide the parent or eligible student with
          the requested documents or make special arrangements if the parent or
          eligible student is not within a commuting distance from the school.
          Under FERPA, documents such as academic calendars, extra-curricular
          activities, and course syllabi are not considered education records.
          Per FERPA guidelines, a school is not required to provide information
          that is not maintained or create an education record upon request from
          the parent or eligible student. Schools are not required to update
          parents or eligible students on progress in a course or school unless
          said education record already exists. Unless requested by a parent or
          eligible student, or there is an outstanding request made, under
          FERPA, schools have the right to maintain and destroy records
          according to their protocol without notifying the parent or eligible
          student. <br />
          Disclosure
          <br /> of Education RecordsUnder FERPA, a school is not allowed to
          generally disclose any personal identifying information of a minor or
          eligible student without the express written consent of the parent or
          eligible student. In some cases, schools are permitted to disclose
          information non-consensually to third-parties. Below is a list of
          cases where schools may disclose personal identifiable information,
          without consent of the parent or eligible student.{" "}
        </p>
        <ul className="md:text-md text-gray-700 max-w-5xl mx-auto font-light list-disc list-outside pl-4 text-left py-8 md:py-16">
          <li>
            School officials, including teachers, can be granted access to the
            student's education records and personal identifiable information if
            the school deems it as a “legitimate school interest.” School
            officials can refer to instructors, health staff, clerical staff,
            counselors, attorneys, disciplinary boards, trustees, or any other
            third-party who has outsourced institutional services or functions.
            Schools must inform parents and eligible students, annually in their
            FERPA Rights updates, what constitutes a “school official” and a
            “legitimate school interest.”
          </li>
          <li>
            Another circumstance is if the student is transferring or enrolling
            into another school. Parents or eligible students can request a copy
            of the records being sent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Under FERPA, schools can disclose personal identifiable information
            if it applies to financial aid (applied for or received) for
            attendance to the school. Information is meant to determine
            eligibility for aid, amount of financial aid granted, terms and
            conditions of aid, and enforcement of terms and conditions of the
            financial aid granted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Personal identifiable information and education records of an
            eligible student can be sent to his or her parents, without consent,
            if said student has been claimed as a dependent on either parent's
            federal income tax forms.
          </li>
          <li>
            In some post-secondary institutions, education records of the
            eligible student can be sent to the parents, non-consensually, in
            the case of a health or safety emergency, regardless if the eligible
            student is claimed as a dependent on their parent's federal tax
            forms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Under FERPA, schools can disclose said personal information of
            education records of eligible students to parents in cases where the
            eligible student has violated any local, State, or Federal law; or
            has been caught with use and/or possession of a controlled substance
            or alcohol under the age of 21.
          </li>
          <li>
            Another case where information on an eligible or minor student may
            be publicly disclosed, without consent, is for “directory
            information.” This type of information includes items, such as,
            name, area of study, class year and level (junior, senior), height
            and weight on an athletic team, birthdate, extracurricular
            activities, degrees and awards received, birthdate, telephone
            listing, email address, dates of attendance, and enrollment status.

          Annual Notification Rights
          <br />
          Schools must notify parents and eligible students of their FERPA
          rights. Information must be provided to parents and eligible students
          of their rights to inspect, review and amend education records, types
          of information that may be disclosed without consent, and the right to
          file a complaint.It must also define what constitutes a “school
          official” and a “legitimate educational interest.” Under FERPA,
          schools are not required to notify parents and eligible students
          individually of these rights. Rather, they may be posted by any means
