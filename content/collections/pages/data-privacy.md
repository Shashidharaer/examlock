The Tech Agent will request permission to access your computer through a remote desktop so that they can diagnose the issue quickly. You will be able to see what they are doing, chat with them, and the whole session will be recorded for security purposes. If you deny access, the agent will talk you through the process over the phone or chat. If you are facing issues during your exam, Onboarding Agent or proctor will direct you to the chat support to work with a tech agent to resolve your issues.'
