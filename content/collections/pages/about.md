        heading: 'ExamLock Lite - Simple, Flexible Browser Security'
        text: 'For lighter use cases, ExamLock Lite offers a secure browser extension that locks down only the browser environment while students test. It prevents opening new tabs, disables copy/paste, and forces full-screen mode to keep learners focused on the exam. Intelligent background monitoring—like random screenshots, mouse tracking, and suspicious activity logging—ensures exam integrity without disrupting the student experience. Think of it as “test mode for your browser,” delivering a secure yet flexible option for online exams.'
