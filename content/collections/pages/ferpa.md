        heading: 'Access to Educational Records'
        text: 'Under the FERPA policy, a school must provide a parent or eligible student with their education records within 45 days of request for documents. The school must provide the parent or eligible student with the requested documents or make special arrangements if the parent or eligible student is not within a commuting distance from the school. Under FERPA, documents such as academic calendars, extra-curricular activities, and course syllabi are not considered education records. Per FERPA guidelines, a school is not required to provide information that is not maintained or create an education record upon request from the parent or eligible student. Schools are not required to update parents or eligible students on progress in a course or school unless said education record already exists. Unless requested by a parent or eligible student, or there is an outstanding request made, under FERPA, schools have the right to maintain and destroy records according to their protocol without notifying the parent or eligible student.'

Schools must inform parents and eligible students, annually in their FERPA Rights updates, what constitutes a “school official” and a “legitimate school interest.”"
