        question: 'What makes your LMS different from other learning platforms?'
        answer: "Our LMS is built specifically for organizations that need both learning and assessment capabilities. Unlike basic LMS platforms, we seamlessly integrate assessments directly into learning paths, use longitudinal assessment tracking to monitor progress over time, and include built-in Quality Management System(QMS) tools for compliance with ISO and regulatory requirements. It's designed for results, not just content delivery."
