        question: 'What exactly does ExamLock Lite do during an exam?'
        answer: 'ExamLock Lite is a browser extension that creates a secure testing environment by locking down the browser. It prevents students from opening new tabs, blocks keyboard shortcuts like copy/paste, forces full-screen mode, and restricts access to unauthorized websites. Think of it as putting the browser in "test mode" where only the exam can be accessed.'
